# BingoProject
Daniel Cheung's Bingo Project:

Specifications: Java 16
Code written by Kason Gu

This was made a significant amount of time *after* the project was
due and should be only used as a reference for future grades that have
the same exact project (Or just use the `Bingo-Project` repository, 
which contains my actual project). 

Dependencies:

 - `java.util.logging` Logging System

 - `FlatLaf` UI System: If applicable. Should work without,
   but Default swing is kind of ugly

 - Java-compatible SFX possible?
